CS131ON Programming project 2

This project contain two programs.

The first program RationalNumber is an updated class that now adds a compareTo Method that tests to see if two Rational Numbers are equviliant or not, testing
is done via the ComparableApplication class

The second program establishes two classes Process and Task which implement the Priority interface. 
The Process class represents processes you might run on you computer, it allows their priority level to be set and then compares the processes against each other based on their priority level
The Task class represents household tasks you might complete at home, it allows their priority level and whether or not they have been completed to be set and then compares the Tasks against each other based on their priority level
Testing of both classes is completed by the TaskPriorityTester application class.
